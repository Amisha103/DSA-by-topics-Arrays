121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 

JAVA-
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;
    int mini =Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    int max_profit = 0;
    for(int i = 0;i < n;i++){
        if(arr[i] < mini)
        {
            mini = arr[i];

        }
        if(arr[i] - mini > max_profit)
        {
            max_profit = arr[i] - mini;

        }
    } 
    return max_profit;
    }
}

PYTHON-
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, arr):
        mini = float('inf')
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            if arr[i] < mini:
                mini = arr[i]
            if arr[i] - mini > max_profit:
                max_profit = arr[i] - mini
        return max_profit
